2
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:48,981
Get up! Get up!

3
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:18,720
The winner, by total annihilation...

4
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,682
Yama!

5
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:22,021
Who is next?

6
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:25,226
Who has the guts to step into
the ring with little yama?

7
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,185
Yama!

8
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,734
Can I try?

9
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,151
I have a robot. I built it myself.

10
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:42,121
Beat it, kid.

11
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:45,041
House rules. You gotta pay to play.

12
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,500
Is this enough?

13
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:50,548
What's your name, little boy?

14
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:53,343
Hiro. Hiro hamada.

15
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:57,091
Prepare your bot, zero.

16
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,569
Two bots enter,

17
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:12,864
one bot leaves.

18
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:13,995
Fighters ready?

19
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:16,277
Fight!

20
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,345
That was my first fight.
I... can I try again?

21
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:33,376
No one likes a sore loser, little boy.

22
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:35,259
Go home.

23
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:36,875
I've got more money.

24
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,349
Fighters ready?

25
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,980
Fight!

26
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:51,266
Mega-bot, destroy.

27
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:58,824
What?

28
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,635
- No more little yama.
- But, wha...

29
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,428
This is not possible!

30
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:29,234
Hey, I'm as surprised as you are.

31
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:30,808
Beginner's luck.

32
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:33,311
Do you want to go again, yama?

33
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,281
- No one hustles yama!
- Whoa. Hey...

34
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,864
Teach him a lesson.

35
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:41,988
Hey, fellas. Let's talk about this.

36
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:46,952
- Hiro! Get on!
- Tadashi!

37
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,624
Good timing!

38
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:55,837
Oh, mama!

39
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:02,548
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

40
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:03,893
- Are you hurt?
- No.

41
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,011
Then what were you thinking,
knucklehead?

42
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:11,774
You graduated high school
when you were 13,

43
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:12,895
and this is what you're doing?

44
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:13,980
There they are!

45
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:15,189
Hey!

46
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:17,531
Hold on!

47
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:19,779
Yes!

48
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,317
Get back here.

49
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:23,449
Bot fighting is illegal.

50
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:25,244
You're going to get yourself arrested.

51
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,410
Bot fighting is not illegal.

52
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,912
Betting on bot fighting,
that's... that's illegal.

53
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:32,171
But so lucrative!

54
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:35,633
I'm on a roll, big brother!
And there is no stopping me!

55
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:38,629
Oh, no.

56
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:51,984
Hi, aunt cass.

57
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,057
Are you guys okay?
Tell me you're okay.

58
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:55,611
- We're fine.
- We're okay.

59
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:56,936
Oh, good.

60
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:59,031
Then what were you
two knuckleheads thinking?

61
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:01,569
For 10 years,

62
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:03,662
I have done the best I could
to raise you.

63
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:05,528
Have I been perfect? No.

64
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,582
Do I know anything about children? No.

65
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,504
Should I have picked up a book
on parenting?

66
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:10,835
Probably!

67
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:13,123
Where was I going with this?
I had a point.

68
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,383
- Sorry.
- We love you, aunt cass.

69
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:16,916
Well, I love you, too!

70
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:20,172
I had to close up early
because of you two felons.

71
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:22,295
On beat poetry night.

72
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,090
Stress eating. Because of you.

73
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,349
Come on, mochi.

74
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,474
This is really good!

75
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:35,349
You better make this up to aunt cass
before she eats everything in the cafe.

76
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:36,649
For sure.

77
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:38,532
And I hope you learned
your lesson, bonehead.

78
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:39,979
Absolutely.

79
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,860
You're going bot fighting, aren't you?

80
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,471
There's a fight across town.
If I book, I can still make it.

81
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,240
When are you gonna
start doing something

82
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,789
with that big brain of yours?

83
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:52,704
What? Go to college like you?

84
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:54,635
So people can tell me stuff
I already know?

85
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:56,422
Unbelievable.

86
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:59,037
What would mom and dad say?

87
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:00,304
I don't know.

88
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:02,012
They're gone.

89
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:03,652
They died when I was three, remember?

90
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,680
Hey!

91
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,137
- I'll take you.
- Really?

92
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:12,468
I can't stop you from going,

93
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:13,889
but I'm not going
to let you go on your own.

94
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,192
Sweet.

95
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:19,865
What are we doing at your nerd school?

96
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:21,567
Bot-fight's that way!

97
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:26,115
Gotta grab something.

98
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:28,818
Is this gonna take long?

99
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:31,282
Relax, you big baby.
We'll be in and out.

100
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:32,915
Anyway, you've never seen my lab.

101
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,751
Oh, great, I get to see your nerd lab!

102
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:35,997
Heads up!

103
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,640
Electro-mag suspension?

104
00:07:57,895 --> 00:07:58,985
Hey!

105
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,270
- Who are you?
- I'm...

106
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,358
Go go, this is my brother Hiro.

107
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,990
Welcome to the nerd lab.

108
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,740
Yeah.

109
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,661
I've never seen electro-mag
suspension on a bike before.

110
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:16,331
Zero resistance, faster bike.

111
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,160
But, not fast enough...

112
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:21,714
yet.

113
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,170
Do not move. Behind the line, please.

114
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:30,974
Hey, wasabi. This is my brother Hiro.

115
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:34,564
Hello, Hiro. Prepare to be amazed.

116
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:36,639
Catch.

117
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:38,693
Wow.

118
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,610
- Laser-induced plasma?
- Oh, yeah.

119
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,610
With a little magnetic confinement
for ultra-precision.

120
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:48,824
Wow. How do you find anything
in this mess?

121
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:50,823
I have a system.

122
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:52,906
There's a place for everything,
and everything in its place.

123
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:54,415
- Need this!
- You can't do that!

124
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:56,618
This is anarchy! Society has rules!

125
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,460
Excuse me!

126
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,075
Coming through!

127
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:01,747
Tadashi!

128
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:04,879
Oh, my gosh. You must be Hiro!

129
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:08,045
I've heard so much about you!

130
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:11,296
Perfect timing. Perfect timing.

131
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,890
That's a whole lot of tungsten carbide.

132
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:16,638
400 pounds of it!

133
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:18,087
Come here, come here, come here.

134
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:19,768
You're going to love this.

135
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:23,057
A dash of perchloric acid,
a smidge of cobalt,

136
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:25,733
a hint of hydrogen peroxide,

137
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,359
super-heated to 500 Kelvin, and...

138
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:34,816
Ta-da! It's pretty great, huh?

139
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:36,367
It's so pink.

140
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:38,288
Here's the best part.

141
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,042
I know, right?

142
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:46,418
Chemical metal embrittlement.

143
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,050
Not bad, honey lemon.

144
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:50,837
"Honey lemon"? "Go go"? "Wasabi"?

145
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:54,051
I spill wasabi on my shirt
one time, people.

146
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:55,513
One time!

147
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,812
Fred is the one who comes up
with the nicknames.

148
00:09:57,973 --> 00:09:59,353
Who's Fred?

149
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,930
This guy, right here!

150
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:03,655
Don't be alarmed. It is just a suit.

151
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,192
This is not my real face and body.

152
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,479
The name's Fred.

153
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:09,528
School mascot by day, but by night...

154
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:12,655
I am also a school mascot.

155
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,203
So, what's your major?

156
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:15,815
No, no, no, I'm not a student.

157
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:18,911
But I am a major science enthusiast.

158
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:21,161
I've been trying to get
honey to develop a formula,

159
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:24,251
that can turn me into
a fire-breathing lizard at will.

160
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,669
But she says that's "not science."

161
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:27,917
It's really not.

162
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,630
Yeah, and I guess the shrink ray

163
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:32,595
I asked wasabi for
isn't "science" either.

164
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:33,796
- Is it?
- Nope.

165
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,637
Well, then, what about
"invisible sandwich"?

166
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:38,847
- Hiro.
- Imagine eating a sandwich,

167
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:40,926
but everybody just thinks you're crazy.

168
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:42,056
Just stop.

169
00:10:42,226 --> 00:10:43,346
- Laser eyes?
- What?

170
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,229
- Tingly fingers?
- Never gonna happen.

171
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:46,677
Hey, what about a growth serum?

172
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,610
So, what have you been working on?

173
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:49,937
I'll show you.

174
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,068
Duct tape?

175
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:55,027
I hate to break it to you, bro.

176
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:56,317
Already been invented.

177
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:57,573
Hey!

178
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:58,874
Dude!

179
00:10:58,909 --> 00:10:59,909
Ow!

180
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:05,171
This is what I've been working on.

181
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,686
Hello. I am baymax.

182
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:34,242
Your personal healthcare companion.

183
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:35,704
I was alerted to the need

184
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:39,163
for medical attention
when you said, "ow."

185
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:41,448
A robotic nurse.

186
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:45,497
On a scale of 1 to 10,
how would you rate your pain?

187
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:47,499
Physical or emotional?

188
00:11:48,584 --> 00:11:49,794
I will scan you now.

189
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,169
Scan complete.

190
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:57,883
You have a slight epidermal
abrasion on your forearm.

191
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,598
I suggest an anti-bacterial spray.

192
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:03,265
What's in the spray, specifically?

193
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:06,353
The primary ingredient is bacitracin.

194
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,020
That's a bummer.
I'm actually allergic to that.

195
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:11,111
You are not allergic to bacitracin.

196
00:12:11,315 --> 00:12:13,405
You do have a mild allergy to

197
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:14,650
peanuts.

198
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:16,358
Not bad.

199
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:19,032
You've done some serious
coding on this thing, huh?

200
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:22,156
Programed him with
over 10,000 medical procedures.

201
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:25,831
This chip is what
makes baymax, baymax.

202
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:29,672
Vinyl?

203
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,963
Yeah, going for a non-threatening,
huggable kind of thing.

204
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,170
Looks like a walking marshmallow.

205
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:36,802
- No offense.
- I am a robot.

206
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:38,217
I cannot be offended.

207
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,390
- Hyperspectral cameras?
- Yep.

208
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,100
- Titanium skeleton?
- Carbon fiber.

209
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:50,442
Right. Even lighter.

210
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,897
Killer actuators.
Where did you get those?

211
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:54,648
Machined them right here, in-house.

212
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:56,035
- Really?
- Yup.

213
00:12:56,193 --> 00:12:57,693
He can lift 1,000 pounds.

214
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:58,861
Shut up.

215
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,529
You have been a good boy.
Have a lollipop.

216
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:03,873
Nice.

217
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:08,458
I cannot deactivate until you say
you are satisfied with your care.

218
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:11,455
Well then, I'm satisfied with my care.

219
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:14,586
He's going to help a lot of people.

220
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:17,709
Hey, what kind of battery does it use?

221
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:18,881
Lithium ion.

222
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,722
You know, supercapacitors
would charge way faster.

223
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:24,965
Burning the midnight oil, Mr. hamada?

224
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:26,055
Hey, Professor.

225
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:28,098
Actually, I was just finishing up.

226
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,390
You must be Hiro.

227
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,056
Bot-fighter, right?

228
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:34,900
When my daughter was younger,
that's all she wanted to do.

229
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:36,147
May I?

230
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,606
Sure.

231
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:41,074
Magnetic-bearing servos.

232
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,451
Pretty sick, huh?

233
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:44,018
Wanna see how I put 'em together?

234
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:45,332
Hey, genius!

235
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:47,286
He invented them.

236
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:49,748
You're Robert Callaghan?

237
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:51,577
Like, as in,

238
00:13:51,707 --> 00:13:53,457
the Callaghan-catmull spline,

239
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:55,109
and Callaghan's "laws of robotics?"

240
00:13:55,294 --> 00:13:56,294
That's right.

241
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:58,128
Ever think about applying here?

242
00:13:58,422 --> 00:13:59,672
Your age wouldn't be an issue.

243
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:00,923
I don't know.

244
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:04,258
He's pretty serious about
his career in bot-fighting.

245
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:05,759
Well, kind of serious.

246
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:06,971
I can see why.

247
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:09,099
With your bot, winning must come easy.

248
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,019
Yeah, I guess.

249
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:15,520
Well, if you like things easy,
then my program isn't for you.

250
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:18,022
We push the boundaries
of robotics here.

251
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:20,655
My students go on to shape the future.

252
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:22,454
Nice to meet you, Hiro.

253
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:24,034
Good luck with the bot-fights.

254
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:29,951
We gotta hurry if you
want to catch that bot-fight.

255
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:31,752
I have to go here.

256
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:33,462
If I don't go to this nerd school,

257
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:34,832
I'm gonna lose my mind.

258
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,245
How do I get in?

259
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:42,222
Every year, the school has
a student showcase.

260
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:45,934
You come up with something
that blows Callaghan away, you're in.

261
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:47,723
But, it's gotta be great.

262
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:52,144
Trust me.

263
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:54,308
It will be.

264
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:04,737
Nothing!

265
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:07,991
No ideas! Useless, empty brain!

266
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:11,332
Wow. Washed up at 14.

267
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:12,451
So sad.

268
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:15,331
I got nothing! I'm done.
I'm never getting in.

269
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:18,342
Hey, I'm not giving up on you.

270
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,380
What are you doing?

271
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,840
Shake things up.

272
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,340
Use that big brain of yours
to think your way out.

273
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:27,511
- What?
- Look for a new angle.

274
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:11,217
Wow, a lot of sweet tech here today.

275
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:12,558
How are you feeling?

276
00:16:12,723 --> 00:16:16,233
You're talking to an ex-bot fighter.
Takes a lot more than this to rattle me.

277
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:18,441
Yep, he's nervous.

278
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,897
You have nothing to fear, little fellow.

279
00:16:20,272 --> 00:16:21,732
- He's so tense.
- No, I'm not.

280
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:23,402
Relax, Hiro.

281
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:26,317
Your tech is amazing. Tell him, go go.

282
00:16:26,612 --> 00:16:28,612
- Stop whining. Woman up.
- I'm fine!

283
00:16:28,906 --> 00:16:31,566
What do you need, little man?
Deodorant? Breath mint?

284
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:32,742
Fresh pair of underpants?

285
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:34,793
Underpants? You need serious help.

286
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:36,005
Hey, I come prepared.

287
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:38,116
I haven't done laundry in six months.

288
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:39,493
One pair lasts me four days.

289
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,916
I go front, I go back, I go inside-out.

290
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:43,749
Then I go front and back.

291
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:46,174
Wow. That is both
disgusting and awesome.

292
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:47,513
Don't encourage him.

293
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:49,088
It's called "recycling."

294
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:51,851
Next presenter, Hiro hamada.

295
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:53,805
Oh, yeah. This is it.

296
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:54,972
I guess I'm up.

297
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:57,267
Okay, photo, photo!
Everybody say, "Hiro."

298
00:16:57,476 --> 00:16:58,846
- Hiro!
- Yeah!

299
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:00,604
We love you, Hiro. Good luck!

300
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:02,194
- Don't mess it up.
- Break a leg, little man.

301
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:03,821
Science, yeah!

302
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:06,106
All right, bro. This is it.

303
00:17:06,652 --> 00:17:08,702
Come on. Don't leave me hanging.

304
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,780
What's going on?

305
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:15,330
I really want to go here.

306
00:17:15,911 --> 00:17:17,001
Hey.

307
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:20,121
You got this.

308
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,800
Hi.

309
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:33,296
My name is Hiro...

310
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,930
Sorry.

311
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,770
My name is Hiro hamada,

312
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:45,318
and I've been working on something
that I think is pretty cool.

313
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:47,316
I hope you like it.

314
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:51,153
This is a microbot.

315
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:01,461
Breathe.

316
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:05,666
It doesn't look like much,

317
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:08,046
but when it links up
with the rest of its pals...

318
00:18:21,977 --> 00:18:24,517
things get a little more interesting.

319
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:33,911
The microbots are controlled
with this neural transmitter.

320
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:41,536
I think what I want them to do...

321
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:45,584
They do it.

322
00:18:49,046 --> 00:18:51,876
The applications for this tech
are limitless.

323
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,510
Construction.

324
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:57,348
What used to take teams
of people working by hand

325
00:18:57,554 --> 00:18:58,764
for months or years,

326
00:18:59,014 --> 00:19:01,564
can now be accomplished
by one person.

327
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:05,057
And that's just the beginning.

328
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:08,769
How about transportation?

329
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:12,397
Microbots can move
anything anywhere,

330
00:19:12,611 --> 00:19:14,201
with ease.

331
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:24,581
If you can think it,
the microbots can do it.

332
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:31,588
The only limit is your imagination.

333
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:35,932
Microbots!

334
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,390
That's my nephew!

335
00:19:44,643 --> 00:19:45,693
Yes!

336
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:48,481
My family! I love my family!

337
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:50,272
Nailed it!

338
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:53,277
- You did it!
- Not bad!

339
00:19:53,652 --> 00:19:55,282
Yeah! You just blew my mind, dude!

340
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:57,779
They loved you. That was amazing!

341
00:19:58,031 --> 00:19:59,281
Yes.

342
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:03,581
With some development,
your tech could be revolutionary.

343
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:05,829
Alistair krei!

344
00:20:06,415 --> 00:20:07,465
May I?

345
00:20:11,003 --> 00:20:13,133
Extraordinary.

346
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,470
I want your microbots at krei tech.

347
00:20:16,675 --> 00:20:18,175
Shut up.

348
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:19,838
Mr. krei is right.

349
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,845
Your microbots are
an inspired piece of tech.

350
00:20:23,098 --> 00:20:24,638
You can continue to develop them,

351
00:20:24,892 --> 00:20:26,312
or you can sell them to a man

352
00:20:26,435 --> 00:20:28,525
who's only guided
by his own self-interest.

353
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,440
Robert, I know how you feel about me,

354
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:32,688
but it shouldn't affect...

355
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:34,478
This is your decision, Hiro.

356
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:35,693
But you should know.

357
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:38,657
Mr. krei has cut corners
and ignored sound science

358
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:39,864
to get where he is.

359
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:41,155
That's just not true.

360
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,870
I wouldn't trust krei tech
with your microbots,

361
00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:46,503
or anything else.

362
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:52,035
Hiro, I'm offering you more money
than any 14-year-old could imagine.

363
00:20:55,339 --> 00:20:58,469
I appreciate the offer, Mr.
krei, but they're not for sale.

364
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:02,394
I thought you were smarter than that.

365
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:04,967
Robert.

366
00:21:05,724 --> 00:21:07,064
Mr. krei.

367
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:09,391
That's my brother's.

368
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,860
That's right.

369
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:21,201
I look forward to seeing you in class.

370
00:21:24,034 --> 00:21:25,874
Unbelievable!

371
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:27,156
That's what I'm talking about.

372
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:29,374
All right, geniuses,
let's feed those hungry brains.

373
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,540
Back to the café!

374
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:32,881
Dinner is on me!

375
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:34,883
Yes! Nothing is better than free food!

376
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:36,878
- Aunt cass?
- Unless it's moldy.

377
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:38,379
We'll... we'll catch up, okay?

378
00:21:38,632 --> 00:21:40,722
Sure. I'm so proud of you.

379
00:21:40,843 --> 00:21:42,593
Both of you.

380
00:21:42,845 --> 00:21:44,935
Thanks, aunt cass.

381
00:21:52,855 --> 00:21:54,275
I know what you're going to say.

382
00:21:54,523 --> 00:21:56,193
"I should be proud of myself,"

383
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,110
"because I'm finally using my gift
for something important."

384
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:02,161
No, no. I was just gonna tell you
your fly was down for the whole show.

385
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:04,119
Ha-ha-hilarious.

386
00:22:05,784 --> 00:22:07,084
What?

387
00:22:13,542 --> 00:22:16,132
Welcome to nerd school, nerd.

388
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:19,456
Hey, I, um...

389
00:22:19,715 --> 00:22:22,435
I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you. So,

390
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:24,433
you know,

391
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:26,432
thanks for not giving up on me.

392
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:41,108
Are you okay?

393
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,780
Yeah. I'm okay.

394
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,570
But Professor Callaghan is still in there.

395
00:22:48,118 --> 00:22:49,448
Tadashi, no!

396
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:56,423
Callaghan's in there.

397
00:22:56,627 --> 00:22:58,797
Someone has to help.

398
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:25,819
Tadashi!

399
00:23:26,698 --> 00:23:28,488
Tadashi!

400
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,040
Here. Have some tea.

401
00:24:51,575 --> 00:24:53,245
Hey, sweetie.

402
00:24:53,535 --> 00:24:54,695
Hey, aunt cass.

403
00:24:54,912 --> 00:24:56,622
Mrs. matsuda's in the café.

404
00:24:56,872 --> 00:24:59,352
She's wearing something
super inappropriate for an 80-year-old.

405
00:25:00,876 --> 00:25:02,416
That always cracks you up.

406
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:04,589
You should come down.

407
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:06,969
Maybe later.

408
00:25:07,591 --> 00:25:09,051
The university called again.

409
00:25:10,385 --> 00:25:13,295
It's been a few weeks
since classes started.

410
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:15,715
But they said it's not
too late to register.

411
00:25:16,266 --> 00:25:19,476
Okay. Thanks. I'll think about it.

412
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:39,959
Hey, Hiro.

413
00:25:40,207 --> 00:25:42,827
We just wanted to check in,
and see how you're doing.

414
00:25:43,085 --> 00:25:44,245
We wish you were here, buddy.

415
00:25:44,378 --> 00:25:47,128
Hiro, if I could have only
one superpower right now,

416
00:25:47,381 --> 00:25:49,671
it would be the ability
to crawl through this camera,

417
00:25:49,925 --> 00:25:51,135
and give you a big hug.

418
00:26:11,864 --> 00:26:12,864
Ow!

419
00:26:48,317 --> 00:26:53,027
Hello. I am baymax,
your personal healthcare companion.

420
00:26:53,405 --> 00:26:55,025
Hey, baymax.

421
00:26:55,199 --> 00:26:57,869
I didn't know you were still active.

422
00:26:58,076 --> 00:27:00,036
I heard a sound of distress.

423
00:27:00,245 --> 00:27:01,655
What seems to be the trouble?

424
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,750
I just stubbed my toe a little.

425
00:27:03,916 --> 00:27:05,126
I'm fine.

426
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:09,209
On a scale of 1 to 10,
how would you rate your pain?

427
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:12,216
A zero. I'm okay, really.

428
00:27:12,466 --> 00:27:14,296
Thanks. You can shrink now.

429
00:27:14,551 --> 00:27:15,971
Does it hurt when I touch it?

430
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,930
That's okay. No touching.

431
00:27:18,096 --> 00:27:19,596
I'm fine...

432
00:27:23,435 --> 00:27:24,435
Ow.

433
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:27,059
You have fallen.

434
00:27:27,231 --> 00:27:28,231
You think?

435
00:27:31,443 --> 00:27:32,743
- On a scale of 1 to...
- Ow!

436
00:27:33,028 --> 00:27:34,108
On a scale...

437
00:27:34,196 --> 00:27:35,276
On a sca...

438
00:27:35,531 --> 00:27:37,621
On a scale of 1 to 10...

439
00:27:37,866 --> 00:27:41,286
On a scale of 1 to 10,
how would you rate your pain?

440
00:27:41,954 --> 00:27:43,084
Zero.

441
00:27:43,288 --> 00:27:45,458
- It is all right to cry.
- No. No, no, no, no.

442
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:47,247
Crying is a natural response to pain.

443
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:48,417
I'm not crying.

444
00:27:48,585 --> 00:27:50,915
- I will scan you for injuries.
- Don't scan me.

445
00:27:51,129 --> 00:27:52,759
- Scan complete.
- Unbelievable.

446
00:27:52,965 --> 00:27:54,765
You have sustained no injuries.

447
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:57,428
However, your hormone
and neurotransmitter levels

448
00:27:57,678 --> 00:28:00,428
indicate that you are
experiencing mood swings

449
00:28:00,597 --> 00:28:01,807
common in adolescence.

450
00:28:02,057 --> 00:28:04,427
Diagnosis, puberty.

451
00:28:04,685 --> 00:28:05,775
What?

452
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:08,359
Okay. Time to shrink now.

453
00:28:08,605 --> 00:28:10,475
You should expect an increase
in body hair,

454
00:28:10,732 --> 00:28:14,112
especially on your face,
chest, armpits, and...

455
00:28:14,361 --> 00:28:15,491
Thank you! That's enough.

456
00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:18,277
You may also experience
strange and powerful new urges.

457
00:28:18,532 --> 00:28:20,282
Okay! Let's get you
back in your luggage.

458
00:28:20,534 --> 00:28:24,454
I cannot deactivate until you say
you are satisfied with your care.

459
00:28:24,705 --> 00:28:27,125
Fine. I'm satisfied with my...

460
00:28:40,012 --> 00:28:41,472
My microbot?

461
00:28:42,139 --> 00:28:43,969
This doesn't make any sense.

462
00:28:44,183 --> 00:28:46,433
Puberty can often be a confusing time

463
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,650
for a young adolescent
flowering into manhood.

464
00:28:48,896 --> 00:28:51,646
No. The thing is attracted
to the other microbots,

465
00:28:51,857 --> 00:28:53,647
but that's impossible.

466
00:28:53,817 --> 00:28:55,817
They were destroyed in the fire.

467
00:28:56,653 --> 00:28:58,993
Dumb thing's broken.

468
00:29:08,916 --> 00:29:11,166
Your tiny robot
is trying to go somewhere.

469
00:29:11,335 --> 00:29:12,345
Oh, yeah?

470
00:29:12,503 --> 00:29:15,013
Why don't you find out
where it's trying to go?

471
00:29:15,255 --> 00:29:17,665
Would that stabilize
your pubescent mood swings?

472
00:29:18,842 --> 00:29:20,222
Absolutely.

473
00:29:25,891 --> 00:29:27,181
Baymax?

474
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,350
Baymax?

475
00:29:31,355 --> 00:29:32,655
Baymax?

476
00:29:41,114 --> 00:29:42,414
What?

477
00:29:47,454 --> 00:29:49,544
- Hiro?
- Hey, aunt cass!

478
00:29:49,748 --> 00:29:50,918
Wow. You're up and...

479
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:52,878
Yeah! I figured it was time.

480
00:29:53,126 --> 00:29:54,916
Are you registering for school?

481
00:29:55,087 --> 00:29:56,087
Yes.

482
00:29:56,338 --> 00:29:57,958
I thought about what you said.
Really inspired me.

483
00:29:58,215 --> 00:30:00,385
Oh, honey, that's so great.

484
00:30:00,717 --> 00:30:01,887
Okay,

485
00:30:02,094 --> 00:30:03,304
special dinner tonight.

486
00:30:03,554 --> 00:30:04,834
I'll whip up some chicken wings.

487
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,390
You know, with the hot sauce
that makes our faces numb.

488
00:30:08,725 --> 00:30:10,225
- Okay, sounds good.
- Great!

489
00:30:10,686 --> 00:30:11,896
Last hug.

490
00:30:22,823 --> 00:30:24,073
Baymax!

491
00:30:31,957 --> 00:30:33,247
- Baymax!
- Hey!

492
00:30:34,543 --> 00:30:35,543
Watch it!

493
00:30:46,722 --> 00:30:47,812
Baymax!

494
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:06,283
Baymax!

495
00:31:07,409 --> 00:31:10,119
Are you crazy? What are you doing?

496
00:31:10,329 --> 00:31:12,869
I have found where
your tiny robot wants to go.

497
00:31:13,624 --> 00:31:17,464
I told you, it's broken.
It's not trying to go...

498
00:31:26,386 --> 00:31:27,676
Locked.

499
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,890
There is a window.

500
00:31:31,725 --> 00:31:33,845
Please exercise caution.

501
00:31:34,102 --> 00:31:36,402
A fall from this height
could lead to bodily harm.

502
00:31:57,292 --> 00:31:58,382
Oh, no.

503
00:31:59,962 --> 00:32:02,382
Excuse me while I let out some air.

504
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:13,599
Are you done?

505
00:32:15,352 --> 00:32:16,352
Yes.

506
00:32:19,273 --> 00:32:21,113
It will take me a moment to re-inflate.

507
00:32:21,358 --> 00:32:23,688
Fine, just keep it down.

508
00:33:10,949 --> 00:33:12,579
My microbots?

509
00:33:16,872 --> 00:33:19,122
Someone's making more.

510
00:33:25,214 --> 00:33:26,344
Hiro?

511
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:28,758
You gave me a heart attack!

512
00:33:28,967 --> 00:33:32,097
My hands are equipped
with defibrillators. Clear.

513
00:33:32,638 --> 00:33:34,928
Stop, stop, stop! It's just an expression.

514
00:33:40,479 --> 00:33:42,309
Oh, no.

515
00:33:45,526 --> 00:33:46,646
Run!

516
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:48,819
Oh, come on!

517
00:33:49,238 --> 00:33:50,318
I am not fast.

518
00:33:50,405 --> 00:33:51,945
Yeah, no kidding!

519
00:33:52,199 --> 00:33:54,619
Go! Go! Come on.

520
00:33:54,826 --> 00:33:56,036
Kick it down!

521
00:33:56,828 --> 00:33:58,958
Then punch it!

522
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:02,132
Go! Go!

523
00:34:07,548 --> 00:34:09,508
Oh, come on! Go, go, go!

524
00:34:18,767 --> 00:34:19,807
Move it!

525
00:34:22,646 --> 00:34:23,806
Come on!

526
00:34:29,361 --> 00:34:31,321
No, no.

527
00:34:37,411 --> 00:34:39,411
Come on! The window!

528
00:34:46,378 --> 00:34:47,498
Suck it in!

529
00:34:49,131 --> 00:34:50,341
Baymax!

530
00:34:50,716 --> 00:34:52,006
Hiro?

531
00:35:01,894 --> 00:35:03,134
Come on, let's get out of here.

532
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:05,020
Go! Hurry!

533
00:35:10,068 --> 00:35:12,108
All right, let me get this straight.

534
00:35:12,362 --> 00:35:15,202
A man in a kabuki mask attacked you,

535
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:17,529
with an army of miniature flying robots.

536
00:35:18,118 --> 00:35:19,198
"Microbots."

537
00:35:20,662 --> 00:35:22,372
- Microbots.
- Yeah.

538
00:35:22,748 --> 00:35:26,288
He was controlling them telepathically
with a neurocranial transmitter.

539
00:35:26,543 --> 00:35:30,213
So, Mr. kabuki was using esp

540
00:35:30,422 --> 00:35:33,052
to attack you and balloon man.

541
00:36:03,539 --> 00:36:07,829
Did you file a report
when your flying robots were stolen?

542
00:36:08,085 --> 00:36:10,095
No. I thought they were all destroyed.

543
00:36:10,337 --> 00:36:13,337
Look, I know it sounds crazy,
but baymax was there, too.

544
00:36:13,841 --> 00:36:15,471
- Tell him.
- Yes, officer.

545
00:36:15,717 --> 00:36:17,427
He's telling the truth.

546
00:36:20,055 --> 00:36:21,765
What the... what's wrong with you?

547
00:36:22,182 --> 00:36:24,602
Low battery.

548
00:36:28,939 --> 00:36:30,439
Try to keep it together.

549
00:36:30,691 --> 00:36:34,611
I'm healthcare,
your personal baymax companion.

550
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:37,320
Kid, how about we call your parents

551
00:36:37,489 --> 00:36:39,659
- and get them down here?
- What?

552
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:43,290
Write your name and number down
on this piece of paper, and we can...

553
00:36:47,791 --> 00:36:50,131
I've gotta get you home
to your charging station.

554
00:36:51,128 --> 00:36:52,128
Can you walk?

555
00:36:52,337 --> 00:36:55,127
I will scan you now. Scan complete.

556
00:36:55,841 --> 00:36:57,681
Healthcare.

557
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:06,809
Okay.

558
00:37:07,019 --> 00:37:10,399
If my aunt asks,
we were at school all day. Got it?

559
00:37:10,647 --> 00:37:12,897
We jumped out a window.

560
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,780
No! Quiet!

561
00:37:15,861 --> 00:37:18,661
We jumped out a window.

562
00:37:18,906 --> 00:37:21,986
You can't say things like that
around aunt cass.

563
00:37:34,171 --> 00:37:35,341
Hiro?

564
00:37:35,547 --> 00:37:36,667
You home, sweetie?

565
00:37:37,674 --> 00:37:38,684
That's right.

566
00:37:38,926 --> 00:37:41,386
I thought I heard you. Hi.

567
00:37:41,637 --> 00:37:43,677
Hey, aunt cass.

568
00:37:44,097 --> 00:37:46,017
Look at my little college man.

569
00:37:46,141 --> 00:37:48,231
I can't wait to hear all about it!

570
00:37:48,477 --> 00:37:49,557
And wings are almost ready.

571
00:37:49,686 --> 00:37:50,686
Whee!

572
00:37:50,729 --> 00:37:51,729
Will you be quiet?

573
00:37:51,897 --> 00:37:54,687
Yeah, wings! Whee!

574
00:37:56,151 --> 00:37:58,571
All right, get ready to have
your face melted.

575
00:37:59,196 --> 00:38:01,696
We are gonna feel
these things tomorrow.

576
00:38:01,865 --> 00:38:03,195
You know what I'm saying?

577
00:38:03,367 --> 00:38:04,367
Okay.

578
00:38:04,535 --> 00:38:06,875
Sit down. Tell me everything.

579
00:38:11,542 --> 00:38:13,632
The thing is that,
since I registered so late,

580
00:38:13,877 --> 00:38:16,127
I've got a lot of school stuff
to catch up on.

581
00:38:17,506 --> 00:38:18,586
What was that?

582
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,380
Mochi.

583
00:38:21,552 --> 00:38:23,892
That darn cat.

584
00:38:26,223 --> 00:38:28,563
At least take a plate for the road, okay?

585
00:38:30,227 --> 00:38:32,897
- Don't work too...
- Thanks for understanding.

586
00:38:34,898 --> 00:38:39,068
Hairy baby. Hairy baby.

587
00:38:40,571 --> 00:38:42,361
All right, come on.

588
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:45,369
I'm healthcare,
your personal baymax companion.

589
00:38:45,576 --> 00:38:46,816
One foot in front of the other.

590
00:39:01,425 --> 00:39:03,685
This doesn't make any sense.

591
00:39:06,597 --> 00:39:08,217
Tadashi.

592
00:39:09,266 --> 00:39:10,346
What?

593
00:39:11,435 --> 00:39:13,025
Tadashi.

594
00:39:17,524 --> 00:39:18,984
Tadashi's gone.

595
00:39:19,234 --> 00:39:21,404
When will he return?

596
00:39:21,612 --> 00:39:23,822
He's dead, baymax.

597
00:39:28,202 --> 00:39:30,662
Tadashi was in excellent health.

598
00:39:30,913 --> 00:39:34,963
With a proper diet and exercise,
he should have lived a long life.

599
00:39:35,459 --> 00:39:37,919
Yeah, he should have.

600
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,380
But there was a fire and...

601
00:39:43,258 --> 00:39:44,548
Now, he's gone.

602
00:39:45,802 --> 00:39:48,052
- Tadashi is here.
- No.

603
00:39:48,305 --> 00:39:50,685
People keep saying
he's not really gone.

604
00:39:50,933 --> 00:39:54,143
As long as we remember him.

605
00:39:55,979 --> 00:39:57,649
It still hurts.

606
00:39:57,898 --> 00:40:00,648
I see no evidence of physical injury.

607
00:40:00,901 --> 00:40:02,571
It's a different kind of hurt.

608
00:40:05,614 --> 00:40:06,874
You are my patient.

609
00:40:07,115 --> 00:40:08,315
I would like to help.

610
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:10,489
You can't fix this one, buddy.

611
00:40:14,248 --> 00:40:15,418
What are you doing?

612
00:40:15,666 --> 00:40:18,746
I am downloading
a database on personal loss.

613
00:40:19,169 --> 00:40:20,459
Database downloaded.

614
00:40:20,671 --> 00:40:24,051
Treatments include contact
with friends and loved ones.

615
00:40:24,299 --> 00:40:25,509
I am contacting them now.

616
00:40:25,759 --> 00:40:27,179
No, no, no! I... don't do that.

617
00:40:27,427 --> 00:40:28,747
Your friends have been contacted.

618
00:40:28,804 --> 00:40:30,564
Unbelievable.

619
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,430
Now, what are you doing?

620
00:40:32,683 --> 00:40:36,393
Other treatments include
compassion and physical reassurance.

621
00:40:36,645 --> 00:40:37,905
I'm okay. Really.

622
00:40:38,146 --> 00:40:41,146
You will be all right. There, there.

623
00:40:42,484 --> 00:40:43,824
Thanks, baymax.

624
00:40:45,362 --> 00:40:47,452
I am sorry about the fire.

625
00:40:47,698 --> 00:40:50,578
It's okay. It was an accident.

626
00:40:57,708 --> 00:40:58,878
Unless...

627
00:40:59,543 --> 00:41:01,213
Unless it wasn't.

628
00:41:02,045 --> 00:41:03,705
At the showcase,

629
00:41:03,881 --> 00:41:06,381
that guy in the mask
stole my microbots. And...

630
00:41:06,592 --> 00:41:09,092
And then set the fire to cover his tracks.

631
00:41:09,386 --> 00:41:12,176
He's responsible for tadashi.

632
00:41:12,723 --> 00:41:14,603
We gotta catch that guy.

633
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:18,849
It's alive!

634
00:41:19,021 --> 00:41:22,441
It's alive, it's alive! It's alive!

635
00:41:26,695 --> 00:41:27,895
If we're gonna catch that guy,

636
00:41:28,071 --> 00:41:29,611
you need some upgrades.

637
00:41:30,407 --> 00:41:33,367
Will apprehending the man in the mask
improve your emotional state?

638
00:41:33,577 --> 00:41:35,197
Absolutely.

639
00:41:35,871 --> 00:41:37,001
Let's work on your moves.

640
00:41:55,766 --> 00:41:58,096
Now, let's take care of this.

641
00:42:30,217 --> 00:42:32,047
I have some concerns.

642
00:42:32,302 --> 00:42:36,062
This armor may undermine
my non-threatening, huggable design.

643
00:42:36,306 --> 00:42:37,966
That's kind of the idea, buddy.

644
00:42:38,058 --> 00:42:39,098
You look sick.

645
00:42:39,893 --> 00:42:42,273
I cannot be sick. I am a robot.

646
00:42:42,646 --> 00:42:44,016
It's just an expression.

647
00:42:44,273 --> 00:42:46,273
Data transfer complete.

648
00:43:11,758 --> 00:43:14,928
I fail to see how karate makes me
a better healthcare companion.

649
00:43:15,596 --> 00:43:17,596
You want to keep me healthy,
don't you?

650
00:43:17,848 --> 00:43:18,968
Punch this.

651
00:43:22,019 --> 00:43:23,849
Yes! Hammerfist!

652
00:43:25,439 --> 00:43:26,609
Side kick!

653
00:43:26,857 --> 00:43:27,977
Knifehand!

654
00:43:28,192 --> 00:43:29,612
Back kick!

655
00:43:29,693 --> 00:43:30,693
Gummy bears!

656
00:43:35,073 --> 00:43:36,123
Yes!

657
00:43:46,835 --> 00:43:48,335
Yeah! Fist bump!

658
00:43:49,713 --> 00:43:52,223
"Fist bump" is not in
my fighting database.

659
00:43:52,841 --> 00:43:54,801
No, this isn't a fighting thing.

660
00:43:55,052 --> 00:43:57,142
It's what people do sometimes

661
00:43:57,554 --> 00:43:59,934
when they're excited or pumped up.

662
00:44:11,568 --> 00:44:13,068
Hey, now you're getting it.

663
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,780
I will add "fist bump"
to my care-giving matrix.

664
00:44:16,031 --> 00:44:18,281
All right. Let's go get that guy.

665
00:44:21,912 --> 00:44:23,372
Come on!

666
00:44:51,066 --> 00:44:52,356
Get him, baymax!

667
00:44:55,904 --> 00:44:57,784
We're too late.

668
00:44:59,616 --> 00:45:01,526
Your tiny robot
is trying to go somewhere.

669
00:45:02,911 --> 00:45:04,451
Come on.

670
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:16,880
Always wait one hour after eating
before swimming.

671
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:19,260
Hey!

672
00:45:27,895 --> 00:45:29,405
Come on!

673
00:45:55,964 --> 00:45:57,564
Your heart rate has
increased dramatic...

674
00:45:58,634 --> 00:46:02,054
Okay, baymax,
time to use those upgrades.

675
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:11,440
- Hiro?
- No, no, no!

676
00:46:11,688 --> 00:46:12,898
Get out of here! Go!

677
00:46:13,148 --> 00:46:14,648
Dude, what are you doing out here?

678
00:46:14,858 --> 00:46:17,278
Nothing! Just out for a walk.

679
00:46:17,528 --> 00:46:19,108
Helps my pubescent mood swings.

680
00:46:19,363 --> 00:46:20,413
Is that baymax?

681
00:46:20,656 --> 00:46:22,156
Yeah, but you really...

682
00:46:22,449 --> 00:46:24,949
Why is he wearing
carbon fiber underpants?

683
00:46:25,202 --> 00:46:26,752
I also know karate.

684
00:46:26,995 --> 00:46:28,035
You guys need to go.

685
00:46:28,121 --> 00:46:31,081
No, don't push us away, Hiro.
We're here for you.

686
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:32,753
That's why baymax contacted us.

687
00:46:33,001 --> 00:46:34,251
Those who suffer a loss,

688
00:46:34,503 --> 00:46:36,673
require support
from friends and loved ones.

689
00:46:36,839 --> 00:46:37,879
Okay, but I...

690
00:46:37,965 --> 00:46:39,805
Who would like
to share their feelings first?

691
00:46:40,008 --> 00:46:41,468
I'll go. Okay.

692
00:46:41,718 --> 00:46:44,138
My name is Fred, and it has
been 30 days since my last...

693
00:46:44,388 --> 00:46:46,008
Holy mother of megazon!

694
00:46:48,976 --> 00:46:50,936
Am I the only one seeing this?

695
00:46:55,566 --> 00:46:58,226
Oh, my gosh! Oh, no!

696
00:47:00,988 --> 00:47:02,068
Go!

697
00:47:02,155 --> 00:47:03,615
Baymax, get him!

698
00:47:04,241 --> 00:47:07,081
No, no, no, no, no! What are you doing?

699
00:47:07,327 --> 00:47:08,537
I'm saving your life.

700
00:47:08,745 --> 00:47:10,905
Baymax can handle that guy!

701
00:47:15,335 --> 00:47:16,495
Oh, no.

702
00:47:19,173 --> 00:47:20,423
Wasabi!

703
00:47:20,674 --> 00:47:22,134
Goodbye!

704
00:47:22,384 --> 00:47:24,054
Hiro. Explanation. Now.

705
00:47:24,261 --> 00:47:26,891
He stole my microbots.
He started the fire.

706
00:47:27,097 --> 00:47:28,517
I don't know who he is!

707
00:47:29,099 --> 00:47:30,269
Baymax, palm-heel strike!

708
00:47:40,277 --> 00:47:41,437
Hard left!

709
00:47:52,623 --> 00:47:55,003
That mask, the black suit...

710
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:57,340
We're under attack
from a super villain, people!

711
00:47:57,586 --> 00:47:59,086
I mean, how cool is that?

712
00:47:59,296 --> 00:48:01,376
I mean, it's scary, obviously.
But how cool!

713
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:07,970
Why are we stopped?

714
00:48:08,013 --> 00:48:09,013
The light's red!

715
00:48:09,264 --> 00:48:11,644
There are no red lights in a car chase!

716
00:48:14,978 --> 00:48:16,598
Why is he trying to kill us?

717
00:48:16,939 --> 00:48:18,979
Why are you trying to kill us?

718
00:48:19,233 --> 00:48:20,873
It's classic villain.
We've seen too much!

719
00:48:20,943 --> 00:48:22,323
Let's not jump to conclusions.

720
00:48:22,569 --> 00:48:24,319
We don't know he's trying to kill us.

721
00:48:24,571 --> 00:48:25,611
Car!

722
00:48:25,656 --> 00:48:26,946
He's trying to kill us!

723
00:48:28,825 --> 00:48:30,325
Did you just put your blinker on?

724
00:48:30,577 --> 00:48:31,907
You have to indicate your turn!

725
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:33,199
It's the law!

726
00:48:33,664 --> 00:48:35,254
That's it.

727
00:49:07,865 --> 00:49:08,995
Stop the car!

728
00:49:09,157 --> 00:49:10,397
Baymax and I can take this guy!

729
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,660
Seatbelts save lives.

730
00:49:16,874 --> 00:49:18,294
Buckle up, every time.

731
00:49:27,968 --> 00:49:29,008
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

732
00:49:29,052 --> 00:49:30,572
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

733
00:49:42,816 --> 00:49:44,856
- Did we lose him?
- Look out!

734
00:49:48,989 --> 00:49:51,449
Baymax, hold on!

735
00:49:52,242 --> 00:49:54,042
- We're not gonna make it!
- We're gonna make it!

736
00:49:54,077 --> 00:49:55,407
- We're not gonna make it!
- We're gonna make it!

737
00:49:55,495 --> 00:49:57,415
- We're not gonna make it!
- We're gonna make it!

738
00:49:59,583 --> 00:50:01,253
We made it! Yes!

739
00:50:38,705 --> 00:50:40,785
I told you we'd make it!

740
00:50:41,041 --> 00:50:43,041
Your injuries require my attention.

741
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:45,250
And your body temperatures are low.

742
00:50:45,921 --> 00:50:46,961
We should get out of here.

743
00:50:47,214 --> 00:50:49,014
I know a place.

744
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:54,049
Where are we?

745
00:50:56,557 --> 00:50:57,887
Fred.

746
00:50:58,141 --> 00:50:59,351
Where are you going?

747
00:51:01,895 --> 00:51:03,515
Welcome to mi casa.

748
00:51:03,772 --> 00:51:05,362
That's French for "front door."

749
00:51:05,607 --> 00:51:07,187
It's really not.

750
00:51:07,442 --> 00:51:08,532
Listen, nitwit.

751
00:51:08,777 --> 00:51:11,197
A lunatic in a mask just tried to kill us.

752
00:51:11,446 --> 00:51:12,816
I'm not in the mood for any...

753
00:51:13,407 --> 00:51:15,487
Welcome home, master Frederick.

754
00:51:15,742 --> 00:51:17,372
Heathcliff, my man!

755
00:51:17,828 --> 00:51:19,828
Come on in, guys. We'll be safe in here.

756
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,120
Gimme some.

757
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:29,960
Freddie,

758
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:31,970
this is your house?

759
00:51:32,176 --> 00:51:33,926
I thought you lived under a bridge.

760
00:51:34,178 --> 00:51:35,968
Well, technically,
it belongs to my parents.

761
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:38,260
They're on a vacay on the family island.

762
00:51:39,308 --> 00:51:41,848
You know, we should
totally go some time. Frolic.

763
00:51:45,105 --> 00:51:46,645
You gotta be kidding me.

764
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:54,490
If I wasn't just attacked
by a guy in a kabuki mask,

765
00:51:54,865 --> 00:51:57,165
I think this would be
the weirdest thing I've seen today.

766
00:51:58,202 --> 00:52:00,412
My brain hates my eyes for seeing this.

767
00:52:01,496 --> 00:52:02,996
Your body temperature is still low.

768
00:52:03,749 --> 00:52:05,039
Yeah.

769
00:52:13,008 --> 00:52:15,588
It's like spooning a warm marshmallow.

770
00:52:15,719 --> 00:52:17,429
It's so nice.

771
00:52:17,679 --> 00:52:19,309
Oh, yeah, that's toasty.

772
00:52:21,058 --> 00:52:23,098
Good robot.

773
00:52:25,854 --> 00:52:27,904
Does this symbol
mean anything to you guys?

774
00:52:28,148 --> 00:52:31,068
- Yes! It's a bird!
- No!

775
00:52:31,318 --> 00:52:34,528
The guy in the mask was carrying
something with this symbol on it.

776
00:52:34,738 --> 00:52:37,868
Apprehending the man in the mask
will improve Hiro's emotional state.

777
00:52:38,075 --> 00:52:39,625
Apprehend him?

778
00:52:39,868 --> 00:52:41,118
We don't even know who he is.

779
00:52:41,370 --> 00:52:42,870
I have a theory.

780
00:52:44,081 --> 00:52:45,921
"Dr. slaughter, md"?

781
00:52:46,208 --> 00:52:48,168
Actually, millionaire weapons designer,

782
00:52:48,335 --> 00:52:49,625
Malcolm chazzletick.

783
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:51,210
"The annihilator"?

784
00:52:51,255 --> 00:52:54,925
Behind the mask,
industrialist reid axworthy.

785
00:52:55,759 --> 00:52:59,139
"Baron Von destruct"?
Just get to the point!

786
00:52:59,388 --> 00:53:00,468
Don't you guys get it?

787
00:53:00,722 --> 00:53:02,932
The man in the mask who attacked us

788
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:04,480
is none other than...

789
00:53:05,185 --> 00:53:06,225
Voilà!

790
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:07,480
Alistair krei.

791
00:53:07,729 --> 00:53:09,189
- What?
- Think about it.

792
00:53:09,439 --> 00:53:11,819
Krei wanted your microbots,
and you said no.

793
00:53:12,109 --> 00:53:14,439
But rules don't apply to a man like krei.

794
00:53:14,778 --> 00:53:17,488
There's no way.
The guy is too high profile.

795
00:53:17,781 --> 00:53:19,531
Then who was that guy in the mask?

796
00:53:19,783 --> 00:53:21,333
I don't know.

797
00:53:21,451 --> 00:53:23,541
We don't know anything about him.

798
00:53:23,787 --> 00:53:25,997
His blood type is ab-negative.

799
00:53:26,248 --> 00:53:27,538
Cholesterol levels are...

800
00:53:27,791 --> 00:53:28,831
Baymax, you scanned him?

801
00:53:29,084 --> 00:53:31,924
I am programed to assess
everyone's healthcare needs.

802
00:53:32,129 --> 00:53:33,509
Yes!

803
00:53:33,755 --> 00:53:36,045
I can use the data
from your scan to find him.

804
00:53:36,216 --> 00:53:38,836
You'd have to scan
everyone in San fransokyo.

805
00:53:39,094 --> 00:53:42,014
That might take, I don't know, forever.

806
00:53:42,264 --> 00:53:43,644
No, no, no, no. I...

807
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:45,887
I just have to look for another angle.

808
00:53:46,476 --> 00:53:47,516
Got it!

809
00:53:47,769 --> 00:53:49,729
I'll scan the whole city at the same time.

810
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:52,230
I just have to upgrade baymax's sensor.

811
00:53:55,319 --> 00:53:57,149
Actually, if we're gonna catch this guy,

812
00:53:57,988 --> 00:53:59,738
I need to upgrade all of you.

813
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:01,030
Upgrade who, now?

814
00:54:01,283 --> 00:54:05,703
Those who suffer a loss require support
from friends and loved ones.

815
00:54:05,829 --> 00:54:08,249
Okay, I like where this is heading!

816
00:54:08,498 --> 00:54:10,918
We can't go against that guy!
We're nerds!

817
00:54:11,168 --> 00:54:12,498
Hiro, we want to help,

818
00:54:12,753 --> 00:54:14,633
but we're just us.

819
00:54:14,963 --> 00:54:15,963
No.

820
00:54:16,173 --> 00:54:19,343
You can be way more.

821
00:54:21,178 --> 00:54:23,848
Tadashi hamada was our best friend.

822
00:54:24,598 --> 00:54:25,968
We're in.

823
00:54:26,517 --> 00:54:28,557
Can you feel it?
You guys, do you feel this?

824
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:30,650
Our origin story begins.

825
00:54:30,979 --> 00:54:32,979
We're gonna be superheroes!

826
00:54:33,857 --> 00:54:35,067
Arms up.

827
00:54:35,526 --> 00:54:37,436
The neurotransmitter
must be in his mask.

828
00:54:37,694 --> 00:54:40,824
We get the mask,
and he can't control the bots.

829
00:54:40,948 --> 00:54:41,988
Game over.

830
00:54:42,199 --> 00:54:44,119
They say
"we are what we are"

831
00:54:44,284 --> 00:54:45,954
but we don't have to be

832
00:54:46,203 --> 00:54:47,913
I'm bad behavior

833
00:54:48,163 --> 00:54:50,713
but I do it in the best way

834
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:52,918
I'll be the watcher

835
00:54:53,210 --> 00:54:54,630
of the eternal flame

836
00:54:55,128 --> 00:54:57,208
I'll be the guard dog

837
00:54:57,464 --> 00:54:59,224
of all your fever dreams

838
00:55:03,303 --> 00:55:06,813
I am the sand in the bottom
half of the hourglass

839
00:55:11,270 --> 00:55:13,730
'cause we could be immortals

840
00:55:14,731 --> 00:55:15,901
immortals

841
00:55:16,149 --> 00:55:18,489
just not for long

842
00:55:18,652 --> 00:55:20,652
for long

843
00:55:20,988 --> 00:55:22,318
live with me forever now

844
00:55:22,573 --> 00:55:24,703
pull the blackout curtains down

845
00:55:25,242 --> 00:55:29,952
just not for long
for long

846
00:55:30,247 --> 00:55:33,957
we could be immortals

847
00:55:35,002 --> 00:55:36,632
immortals

848
00:55:37,087 --> 00:55:39,257
immortals

849
00:55:40,591 --> 00:55:41,721
immortals

850
00:55:41,925 --> 00:55:43,885
sometimes the only payoff

851
00:55:44,094 --> 00:55:46,304
for having any faith

852
00:55:46,555 --> 00:55:48,565
is when it's tested again

853
00:55:48,765 --> 00:55:50,055
and again every day

854
00:55:51,101 --> 00:55:53,061
I'm still comparing your past

855
00:55:53,228 --> 00:55:55,188
to my future

856
00:55:55,898 --> 00:55:57,938
'cause we could be immortals

857
00:55:59,443 --> 00:56:00,783
immortals

858
00:56:01,028 --> 00:56:03,818
just not for long
for long

859
00:56:04,114 --> 00:56:05,624
super jump!

860
00:56:05,824 --> 00:56:06,834
Super jump!

861
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:08,070
And live with me forever now

862
00:56:08,118 --> 00:56:09,698
pull the blackout curtains down.

863
00:56:09,786 --> 00:56:11,576
- I breathe fire.
- Just not for long

864
00:56:11,747 --> 00:56:12,787
for long

865
00:56:14,249 --> 00:56:18,379
we could be immortals
immortals

866
00:56:19,296 --> 00:56:21,546
immortals

867
00:56:22,132 --> 00:56:23,722
immortals

868
00:56:24,468 --> 00:56:26,088
immortals

869
00:56:26,512 --> 00:56:28,012
immortals

870
00:56:28,138 --> 00:56:30,518
immortals

871
00:56:31,058 --> 00:56:32,558
immortals

872
00:56:33,644 --> 00:56:35,604
immortals

873
00:56:37,189 --> 00:56:38,229
I love it!

874
00:56:38,315 --> 00:56:39,445
Not bad.

875
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:41,440
Anybody else's suit riding up on them?

876
00:56:41,527 --> 00:56:42,567
Hey, guys!

877
00:56:42,986 --> 00:56:44,646
Check this out.

878
00:56:44,905 --> 00:56:46,325
I'd like to introduce,

879
00:56:46,573 --> 00:56:49,453
baymax 2.0.

880
00:56:54,957 --> 00:56:56,957
He's glorious.

881
00:56:59,169 --> 00:57:00,549
Hello.

882
00:57:04,341 --> 00:57:06,591
Hold up. Focus.

883
00:57:06,844 --> 00:57:09,014
Show 'em what you got, buddy.

884
00:57:09,263 --> 00:57:11,433
The fist, show them the fist.

885
00:57:15,853 --> 00:57:17,603
No, not that.

886
00:57:17,855 --> 00:57:20,525
The thing, the other thing.

887
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:29,870
Rocket fist make Freddie so happy!

888
00:57:31,326 --> 00:57:33,406
That's just one of his new upgrades!

889
00:57:33,662 --> 00:57:35,332
Baymax, wings.

890
00:57:36,123 --> 00:57:38,173
No way!

891
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:46,800
Thrusters.

892
00:57:48,135 --> 00:57:49,435
I fail to see how flying

893
00:57:49,553 --> 00:57:51,473
makes me a better
healthcare companion.

894
00:57:51,722 --> 00:57:54,772
I fail to see how you fail to see
that it's awesome!

895
00:57:55,142 --> 00:57:56,312
Full thrust.

896
00:58:06,653 --> 00:58:07,743
Steady, big guy.

897
00:58:09,072 --> 00:58:10,662
Look, let's just take this slow.

898
00:58:10,782 --> 00:58:12,832
Up, up, up, up, up!

899
00:58:12,951 --> 00:58:14,241
Thrust, thrust, thrust!

900
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:18,040
Too much thrust! Too much thrust!

901
00:58:18,207 --> 00:58:19,667
Too much thrust!

902
00:58:23,086 --> 00:58:24,086
No, no, no, no!

903
00:58:24,296 --> 00:58:25,336
Back on! Back on!

904
00:58:25,589 --> 00:58:26,719
On! On! On!

905
00:58:30,427 --> 00:58:31,717
Zoom...

906
00:58:33,597 --> 00:58:36,427
Go up! Up, up, up!

907
00:58:36,475 --> 00:58:37,485
Up!

908
00:58:41,438 --> 00:58:42,978
Oh, man!

909
00:58:43,106 --> 00:58:45,066
Maybe...
Maybe enough flying for today.

910
00:58:46,693 --> 00:58:48,363
What do you say?

911
00:58:48,612 --> 00:58:51,162
Your neurotransmitter levels
are rising steadily.

912
00:58:51,406 --> 00:58:53,656
Which means what?

913
00:58:54,451 --> 00:58:56,291
The treatment is working.

914
00:58:57,538 --> 00:58:58,828
Oh, no!

915
00:58:59,206 --> 00:59:00,416
No, no, no, no, no!

916
00:59:00,624 --> 00:59:02,384
Whoa, baymax!

917
00:59:07,923 --> 00:59:09,093
Yes!

918
00:59:41,999 --> 00:59:42,999
Yeah!

919
01:00:37,137 --> 01:00:38,347
Yes!

920
01:00:59,076 --> 01:01:00,156
Wow!

921
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:04,290
That was...

922
01:01:05,916 --> 01:01:07,416
That was...

923
01:01:07,876 --> 01:01:09,086
Sick.

924
01:01:10,087 --> 01:01:12,297
It is just an expression.

925
01:01:12,548 --> 01:01:14,548
That's... that's right, buddy.

926
01:01:18,595 --> 01:01:21,385
I am never taking the bus again.

927
01:01:24,768 --> 01:01:27,438
Your emotional state has improved.

928
01:01:27,938 --> 01:01:31,478
I can deactivate if you say
you are satisfied with your care.

929
01:01:31,984 --> 01:01:33,404
What?

930
01:01:33,610 --> 01:01:35,240
No, I don't want you to deactivate.

931
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:37,910
We still have to find that guy.

932
01:01:38,031 --> 01:01:40,031
So, fire up that super-sensor.

933
01:01:45,581 --> 01:01:47,211
Functionality improved.

934
01:01:47,457 --> 01:01:50,287
1000% increase in range.

935
01:01:52,462 --> 01:01:54,842
I have found a match...

936
01:01:56,133 --> 01:01:57,973
on that island.

937
01:02:02,639 --> 01:02:04,599
- Killer view.
- Yeah. If I...

938
01:02:04,808 --> 01:02:06,768
If I wasn't terrified of heights,

939
01:02:06,935 --> 01:02:08,055
I'd probably love this.

940
01:02:08,145 --> 01:02:10,525
But I'm terrified of heights,
so I don't love it.

941
01:02:16,111 --> 01:02:19,241
There. Baymax, take us in.

942
01:02:25,787 --> 01:02:26,827
Awesome!

943
01:02:26,997 --> 01:02:29,287
Our first landing together as a team.

944
01:02:29,499 --> 01:02:31,249
Guys, come on.

945
01:02:31,502 --> 01:02:32,502
"Quarantine"?

946
01:02:32,836 --> 01:02:35,416
Do you people know
what "quarantine" means?

947
01:02:35,672 --> 01:02:37,552
"Quarantine." Enforced isolation

948
01:02:37,799 --> 01:02:39,839
to prevent contamination
that could lead to disease,

949
01:02:40,093 --> 01:02:41,683
or, in some cases, death.

950
01:02:41,929 --> 01:02:44,219
There's a skull face on this one.

951
01:02:44,348 --> 01:02:45,428
A skull face!

952
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:46,809
Be ready.

953
01:02:47,017 --> 01:02:48,847
He could be anywhere.

954
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:53,060
Fire!

955
01:02:53,524 --> 01:02:55,364
Spitting fire! Spitting fire!

956
01:03:02,824 --> 01:03:04,414
That was a bird.

957
01:03:05,369 --> 01:03:08,959
Well, at least we know our gear works.

958
01:03:24,054 --> 01:03:26,104
Six intrepid friends

959
01:03:26,223 --> 01:03:27,523
led by Fred

960
01:03:27,683 --> 01:03:29,353
their leader, Fred.

961
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,850
Fred's angels.

962
01:03:32,229 --> 01:03:34,439
Fred's angels

963
01:03:34,731 --> 01:03:36,571
harnessing the power of the sun

964
01:03:36,817 --> 01:03:40,197
with the ancient amulet
they found in the attic

965
01:03:41,989 --> 01:03:44,739
the amulet is green

966
01:03:44,908 --> 01:03:46,278
it's probably an emerald

967
01:03:46,535 --> 01:03:48,665
Fred, I will laser-hand you in the face.

968
01:03:48,912 --> 01:03:50,292
Guys.

969
01:03:50,706 --> 01:03:52,206
Any sign of him, baymax?

970
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:56,420
This structure is
interfering with my sensor.

971
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:59,170
Perfect. The robot's broken.

972
01:03:59,923 --> 01:04:03,643
Guys, you might want to see this.

973
01:04:15,856 --> 01:04:18,016
What do you think it is, genius?

974
01:04:18,275 --> 01:04:20,865
I'm not sure. But look.

975
01:04:22,613 --> 01:04:23,613
Hiro.

976
01:04:50,807 --> 01:04:52,267
Krei.

977
01:04:56,730 --> 01:04:57,860
That's right.

978
01:04:57,981 --> 01:05:00,401
We were asked to do the impossible.

979
01:05:00,567 --> 01:05:01,567
That's what we did.

980
01:05:02,653 --> 01:05:06,453
We've reinvented
the very concept of transportation.

981
01:05:06,657 --> 01:05:11,157
Friends, I present
project silent sparrow.

982
01:05:17,167 --> 01:05:19,457
General, may I?

983
01:05:26,385 --> 01:05:27,725
Magic hat!

984
01:05:32,641 --> 01:05:34,021
Teleportation.

985
01:05:34,184 --> 01:05:36,984
The transport of matter
instantaneously through space.

986
01:05:37,479 --> 01:05:40,269
Not science fiction anymore.

987
01:05:41,358 --> 01:05:44,358
Now, we didn't spend billions
of tax dollars

988
01:05:44,611 --> 01:05:45,821
to teleport hats.

989
01:05:46,488 --> 01:05:49,868
Ladies and gentlemen,
you're here to witness history.

990
01:05:50,367 --> 01:05:51,737
Ready to go for a ride, Abigail?

991
01:05:52,703 --> 01:05:54,623
We've invited all these people.

992
01:05:54,788 --> 01:05:56,368
Might as well give 'em a show.

993
01:05:56,665 --> 01:05:59,295
T-minus 30 seconds to launch.

994
01:06:00,878 --> 01:06:02,588
- 29... 28...
- This is argo.

995
01:06:02,713 --> 01:06:04,423
- Capsule's in position.
- 27...

996
01:06:04,548 --> 01:06:08,298
Sir, we've picked up a slight irregularity
in the magnetic containment field.

997
01:06:08,468 --> 01:06:11,218
Mr. krei, is there a problem?

998
01:06:11,471 --> 01:06:12,811
No. No problem.

999
01:06:13,056 --> 01:06:15,426
It's well within the parameters.

1000
01:06:15,559 --> 01:06:16,939
Let's move forward.

1001
01:06:17,186 --> 01:06:18,936
3... 2... 1...

1002
01:06:19,062 --> 01:06:20,612
Cabin pressure is go.

1003
01:06:20,856 --> 01:06:22,646
Pod engaged.

1004
01:06:26,153 --> 01:06:27,783
Field breach! Abort!

1005
01:06:28,030 --> 01:06:30,160
We've lost all contact with the pod.

1006
01:06:32,492 --> 01:06:33,542
Oh, no.

1007
01:06:33,744 --> 01:06:35,304
- It's breaking up!
- The pilot is gone.

1008
01:06:35,746 --> 01:06:37,206
Portal two is down.

1009
01:06:38,749 --> 01:06:40,379
The magnetic
containment field's down!

1010
01:06:44,505 --> 01:06:47,635
Krei, shut it down now!

1011
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,340
I want this island sealed off!

1012
01:06:51,595 --> 01:06:53,395
The government shut down
krei's experiment.

1013
01:06:53,597 --> 01:06:56,347
And he's using your microbots
to steal his machine back.

1014
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:58,480
Krei is the guy in the mask.

1015
01:06:59,061 --> 01:07:00,351
Oh, no.

1016
01:07:10,531 --> 01:07:12,621
Baymax, get us out of here.

1017
01:07:18,789 --> 01:07:19,999
Go for the transmitter.

1018
01:07:20,249 --> 01:07:21,669
Behind his mask.

1019
01:07:25,462 --> 01:07:26,552
Baymax!

1020
01:07:27,548 --> 01:07:28,668
All right, what's the plan?

1021
01:07:28,924 --> 01:07:30,224
It's Fred time.

1022
01:07:31,218 --> 01:07:32,298
Super jump!

1023
01:07:32,970 --> 01:07:33,970
Gravity crush!

1024
01:07:34,638 --> 01:07:36,508
Falling hard.

1025
01:07:37,224 --> 01:07:38,354
Seriously, what is the plan?

1026
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:40,890
- Get the mask.
- Right behind you.

1027
01:07:41,144 --> 01:07:43,104
For real, what is the plan?

1028
01:08:15,470 --> 01:08:16,510
Hey!

1029
01:08:22,019 --> 01:08:23,019
Hey!

1030
01:08:24,855 --> 01:08:27,905
You want to dance, masked man?

1031
01:08:28,150 --> 01:08:29,780
'Cause you'll be dancing with these.

1032
01:08:30,110 --> 01:08:32,900
Hand over the mask,
or you'll get a taste of this!

1033
01:08:33,155 --> 01:08:34,165
And a little bit of that!

1034
01:08:40,704 --> 01:08:42,584
Hey! I did all right.

1035
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,670
Is that all you got?

1036
01:08:45,542 --> 01:08:47,252
You got that, too?

1037
01:08:49,213 --> 01:08:50,423
It's back into the fire!

1038
01:09:23,747 --> 01:09:25,247
It's over, krei.

1039
01:09:32,422 --> 01:09:34,382
Pro... Professor Callaghan?

1040
01:09:36,927 --> 01:09:38,797
The explosion...

1041
01:09:39,096 --> 01:09:40,136
You died.

1042
01:09:40,389 --> 01:09:42,809
No. I had your microbots.

1043
01:09:46,019 --> 01:09:48,809
But, tadashi.

1044
01:09:49,064 --> 01:09:50,074
You just let him die.

1045
01:09:50,274 --> 01:09:52,484
Give me the mask, Hiro.

1046
01:09:52,734 --> 01:09:54,114
He went in there to save you!

1047
01:09:54,361 --> 01:09:55,651
That was his mistake!

1048
01:10:00,784 --> 01:10:02,794
Baymax, destroy.

1049
01:10:04,454 --> 01:10:07,254
My programing prevents me
from injuring a human being.

1050
01:10:07,457 --> 01:10:08,707
Not anymore.

1051
01:10:12,754 --> 01:10:14,634
Hiro, this is not what...

1052
01:10:18,135 --> 01:10:20,515
Do it, baymax! Destroy him!

1053
01:10:25,559 --> 01:10:27,019
No! Stop, baymax!

1054
01:10:38,655 --> 01:10:40,905
No, stop! He's getting away!

1055
01:10:45,996 --> 01:10:47,746
Baymax!

1056
01:11:11,855 --> 01:11:14,105
My healthcare protocol
has been violated.

1057
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:22,870
I regret any distress I may have caused.

1058
01:11:23,116 --> 01:11:25,366
How could you do that? I had him!

1059
01:11:25,619 --> 01:11:28,369
What you just did,
we never signed up for.

1060
01:11:28,622 --> 01:11:30,712
We said we'd catch the guy.

1061
01:11:30,958 --> 01:11:31,958
That's it.

1062
01:11:32,209 --> 01:11:34,089
I never should have let you help me!

1063
01:11:34,336 --> 01:11:36,046
Baymax, find Callaghan.

1064
01:11:38,215 --> 01:11:40,225
My enhanced scanner
has been damaged.

1065
01:11:43,387 --> 01:11:44,677
Wings.

1066
01:11:45,639 --> 01:11:47,059
Hiro, this isn't part of the plan.

1067
01:11:47,307 --> 01:11:48,557
Fly!

1068
01:11:48,809 --> 01:11:50,349
Hiro!

1069
01:12:07,828 --> 01:12:09,748
Your blood pressure is elevated.

1070
01:12:10,372 --> 01:12:12,172
You appear to be distressed.

1071
01:12:12,416 --> 01:12:13,876
I'm fine!

1072
01:12:15,586 --> 01:12:16,876
There. Is it working?

1073
01:12:20,090 --> 01:12:22,800
- My sensor is operational.
- Good.

1074
01:12:23,343 --> 01:12:24,593
Then let's get...

1075
01:12:25,179 --> 01:12:26,299
What?

1076
01:12:26,555 --> 01:12:28,605
Are you going to remove
my healthcare chip?

1077
01:12:28,849 --> 01:12:30,429
Yes. Open!

1078
01:12:31,018 --> 01:12:32,518
My purpose is to heal
the sick and injured.

1079
01:12:32,686 --> 01:12:34,686
Baymax, open your access port.

1080
01:12:35,439 --> 01:12:37,479
Do you want me to terminate
Professor Callaghan?

1081
01:12:37,733 --> 01:12:39,613
Just open!

1082
01:12:42,237 --> 01:12:45,527
Will terminating Professor Callaghan
improve your emotional state?

1083
01:12:45,782 --> 01:12:47,912
Yes! No! I don't know!

1084
01:12:48,118 --> 01:12:49,158
Open your access!

1085
01:12:49,411 --> 01:12:51,661
- Is this what tadashi wanted?
- It doesn't matter!

1086
01:12:51,914 --> 01:12:53,274
Tadashi programed me to aid and...

1087
01:12:53,582 --> 01:12:55,462
Tadashi's gone!

1088
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:02,380
Tadashi's gone.

1089
01:13:03,634 --> 01:13:05,514
Tadashi is here.

1090
01:13:05,886 --> 01:13:09,056
No. He's not here.

1091
01:13:09,556 --> 01:13:12,096
Tadashi is here.

1092
01:13:12,726 --> 01:13:15,096
This is tadashi hamada.

1093
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:19,940
And this is the first test
of my robotics project.

1094
01:13:20,150 --> 01:13:22,440
Hello, I am baymax.

1095
01:13:22,653 --> 01:13:24,243
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

1096
01:13:26,490 --> 01:13:29,370
The seventh test of my robotics project.

1097
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:30,790
Hello, I...

1098
01:13:31,453 --> 01:13:33,123
What? What?

1099
01:13:33,497 --> 01:13:35,417
Wait, wait, wait, stop!
Stop scan! Stop...

1100
01:13:36,959 --> 01:13:38,999
Tadashi hamada again,

1101
01:13:39,253 --> 01:13:43,423
and this is the 33rd test
of my robotics project.

1102
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:52,100
I'm not giving up on you.

1103
01:13:52,349 --> 01:13:54,889
You don't understand this yet,
but people need you.

1104
01:13:55,143 --> 01:13:56,733
So, let's get back to work.

1105
01:13:58,689 --> 01:14:00,019
This is tadashi hamada,

1106
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:03,650
and this is the 84th test.

1107
01:14:05,821 --> 01:14:07,451
What do you say, big guy?

1108
01:14:07,698 --> 01:14:10,078
Hello, I am baymax,

1109
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:12,160
your personal healthcare companion.

1110
01:14:12,369 --> 01:14:13,449
It works.

1111
01:14:13,662 --> 01:14:14,832
It works!

1112
01:14:14,872 --> 01:14:17,502
This is amazing! You... you work!

1113
01:14:18,041 --> 01:14:20,091
I knew it! I knew it! I knew it.

1114
01:14:20,335 --> 01:14:23,375
I knew it. Oh, you work.
I can't believe it! I can't...

1115
01:14:23,630 --> 01:14:26,010
Okay. All right, big moment, here.

1116
01:14:26,842 --> 01:14:28,392
Scan me.

1117
01:14:29,553 --> 01:14:32,313
Your neurotransmitter
levels are elevated.

1118
01:14:32,556 --> 01:14:34,596
This indicates that you are happy.

1119
01:14:34,850 --> 01:14:37,140
I am. I really am.

1120
01:14:37,728 --> 01:14:41,188
Oh, man. Wait till my brother sees you.

1121
01:14:41,857 --> 01:14:44,107
You're gonna help
so many people, buddy.

1122
01:14:44,359 --> 01:14:45,859
So many.

1123
01:14:46,069 --> 01:14:49,739
That's all for now.
I am satisfied with my care.

1124
01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:01,790
Thank you, baymax.

1125
01:15:04,922 --> 01:15:06,842
I'm so sorry.

1126
01:15:08,258 --> 01:15:10,548
I guess I'm not like my brother.

1127
01:15:11,261 --> 01:15:12,551
Hiro.

1128
01:15:16,350 --> 01:15:19,060
Guys, I... I...

1129
01:15:22,773 --> 01:15:24,983
We're going to catch Callaghan,

1130
01:15:25,234 --> 01:15:27,364
and, this time, we'll do it right.

1131
01:15:30,113 --> 01:15:33,243
But maybe don't leave your team
stranded on a spooky island next time.

1132
01:15:33,951 --> 01:15:36,241
- Oh, man.
- Nah, it's cool.

1133
01:15:36,411 --> 01:15:38,461
Heathcliff picked us up
in the family chopper.

1134
01:15:38,705 --> 01:15:41,415
Hiro, we found something
you should see.

1135
01:15:45,587 --> 01:15:46,757
You almost got us all killed!

1136
01:15:46,964 --> 01:15:49,094
Krei! You did this!

1137
01:15:49,299 --> 01:15:51,049
You knew it wasn't ready!

1138
01:15:51,802 --> 01:15:53,972
Callaghan? He was there?

1139
01:15:54,304 --> 01:15:57,274
He was such a good man.
What happened?

1140
01:15:57,474 --> 01:15:58,734
I don't know.

1141
01:15:58,892 --> 01:16:00,692
But the answer's here somewhere.

1142
01:16:01,478 --> 01:16:03,358
Wait, wait! Stop.

1143
01:16:03,605 --> 01:16:05,145
There he is.

1144
01:16:05,983 --> 01:16:07,983
With the pilot.

1145
01:16:10,153 --> 01:16:11,403
Hang on.

1146
01:16:12,906 --> 01:16:14,486
We've invited all these people...

1147
01:16:17,828 --> 01:16:19,748
The pilot was Callaghan's daughter.

1148
01:16:19,997 --> 01:16:21,957
Callaghan blames krei.

1149
01:16:22,165 --> 01:16:24,575
This is a revenge story.

1150
01:16:24,835 --> 01:16:26,675
So, what are we waiting for?

1151
01:16:28,422 --> 01:16:29,672
It's all set up.

1152
01:16:33,677 --> 01:16:38,347
This beautiful new campus
is the culmination of a lifelong dream.

1153
01:16:39,016 --> 01:16:41,136
But none of this
would've been possible

1154
01:16:41,351 --> 01:16:43,601
without a few bumps in the road.

1155
01:16:43,854 --> 01:16:48,274
Those setbacks made us stronger,
and set us on the path

1156
01:16:48,442 --> 01:16:49,532
to a bright future.

1157
01:16:49,860 --> 01:16:51,110
What is that?

1158
01:16:52,029 --> 01:16:53,609
- What?
- Setback?

1159
01:17:06,126 --> 01:17:08,496
Was my daughter a "setback"?

1160
01:17:08,712 --> 01:17:10,922
Callaghan! But you...

1161
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,010
Your daughter, that...

1162
01:17:13,217 --> 01:17:14,507
That was an accident.

1163
01:17:14,718 --> 01:17:17,548
No! You knew it was unsafe.

1164
01:17:17,804 --> 01:17:20,274
My daughter is gone
because of your arrogance.

1165
01:17:33,028 --> 01:17:34,148
What are you doing?

1166
01:17:34,404 --> 01:17:38,454
You took everything from me when
you sent Abigail into that machine.

1167
01:17:39,243 --> 01:17:42,253
Now I'm taking everything from you.

1168
01:17:46,583 --> 01:17:47,583
No!

1169
01:17:47,709 --> 01:17:49,339
No! No! You can't!

1170
01:17:57,094 --> 01:18:01,064
You're going to watch
everything you've built disappear.

1171
01:18:01,682 --> 01:18:02,812
Then, it's your turn.

1172
01:18:03,058 --> 01:18:04,678
Professor Callaghan!

1173
01:18:09,314 --> 01:18:10,324
Let him go!

1174
01:18:12,901 --> 01:18:14,381
Is this what Abigail would've wanted?

1175
01:18:14,528 --> 01:18:16,198
Abigail is gone!

1176
01:18:17,281 --> 01:18:21,531
This won't change anything.
Trust me, I know.

1177
01:18:23,787 --> 01:18:25,407
Listen to the kid, Callaghan.

1178
01:18:25,622 --> 01:18:26,622
Please, let me go.

1179
01:18:26,790 --> 01:18:28,790
I'll give you anything you want!

1180
01:18:29,251 --> 01:18:32,421
I want my daughter back!

1181
01:18:36,258 --> 01:18:37,298
Go for the mask!

1182
01:18:54,401 --> 01:18:55,571
Baymax!

1183
01:18:55,736 --> 01:18:57,236
Leaping into action!

1184
01:19:21,345 --> 01:19:22,685
Oh, no!

1185
01:19:32,856 --> 01:19:34,516
Getting a little tight.

1186
01:19:48,789 --> 01:19:50,789
- No!
- He's too strong!

1187
01:19:51,124 --> 01:19:53,134
- There's no way out!
- You can't beat him!

1188
01:19:53,377 --> 01:19:54,627
Help! I can't beat him.

1189
01:19:54,795 --> 01:19:56,055
Hiro!

1190
01:19:56,213 --> 01:19:58,473
- Hiro? Hiro?
- Help!

1191
01:19:59,132 --> 01:20:00,182
- That's it!
- Hiro.

1192
01:20:00,342 --> 01:20:01,622
- I know how to beat him.
- Hiro.

1193
01:20:02,553 --> 01:20:03,643
Listen up!

1194
01:20:03,887 --> 01:20:05,057
Use those big brains of yours

1195
01:20:05,222 --> 01:20:06,702
and think your way
around the problem.

1196
01:20:07,516 --> 01:20:09,176
Look for a new angle.

1197
01:20:21,697 --> 01:20:24,237
My arms! They can't go any further!

1198
01:20:25,742 --> 01:20:28,752
Wait a second, it's a suit.

1199
01:20:29,204 --> 01:20:30,624
Hello, sign.

1200
01:20:30,873 --> 01:20:33,123
Care to go for a little spin?

1201
01:20:33,250 --> 01:20:34,750
Double spin!

1202
01:20:35,919 --> 01:20:36,919
Behind-the-back spin!

1203
01:20:37,087 --> 01:20:38,247
Yeah!

1204
01:20:38,839 --> 01:20:39,839
Yeah!

1205
01:20:50,601 --> 01:20:51,771
Baymax!

1206
01:20:57,191 --> 01:20:58,781
Hiro.

1207
01:21:16,752 --> 01:21:18,132
I love that robot!

1208
01:21:24,968 --> 01:21:28,138
Okay, new plan. Forget the mask.

1209
01:21:28,430 --> 01:21:30,670
Take out the bots.
They'll get sucked up into the portal.

1210
01:21:30,974 --> 01:21:32,234
Now that is a plan!

1211
01:21:32,476 --> 01:21:34,436
Honey, Fred,
can you give us some cover?

1212
01:21:34,811 --> 01:21:36,401
Like you have to ask.

1213
01:21:36,647 --> 01:21:37,647
Let's do this, Freddie!

1214
01:21:38,315 --> 01:21:39,615
Smokescreen!

1215
01:21:51,745 --> 01:21:54,155
Ready and

1216
01:21:55,123 --> 01:21:56,253
dive!

1217
01:22:03,966 --> 01:22:06,216
Whoa, the gravity's getting
a little weird here, guys!

1218
01:22:06,343 --> 01:22:07,433
Wait.

1219
01:22:07,594 --> 01:22:08,764
Let's use this!

1220
01:22:12,432 --> 01:22:14,852
These are green blades of fury!

1221
01:22:16,436 --> 01:22:17,806
Woman up!

1222
01:22:24,319 --> 01:22:25,899
Double sign-spin.

1223
01:22:26,154 --> 01:22:28,284
Now my signs are on fire!

1224
01:22:36,331 --> 01:22:38,631
Now that's a chemical reaction!

1225
01:22:41,712 --> 01:22:45,222
Back kick. Knifehand. Roundhouse.

1226
01:22:45,465 --> 01:22:46,755
Hammerfist.

1227
01:22:51,805 --> 01:22:54,385
This ends now!

1228
01:23:00,314 --> 01:23:02,074
Looks like you're out of microbots.

1229
01:23:02,316 --> 01:23:03,316
What?

1230
01:23:07,321 --> 01:23:08,411
Baymax!

1231
01:23:11,241 --> 01:23:12,241
No!

1232
01:23:20,501 --> 01:23:24,211
Our programing prevents us
from injuring a human being.

1233
01:23:24,421 --> 01:23:26,801
But we'll take that.

1234
01:23:56,912 --> 01:23:59,542
It's still on! We have to shut it down!

1235
01:23:59,790 --> 01:24:02,000
We can't!
The containment field is failing.

1236
01:24:02,251 --> 01:24:04,421
The portal is gonna tear itself apart!

1237
01:24:04,628 --> 01:24:06,298
We need to get out of here, now!

1238
01:24:12,970 --> 01:24:13,970
Baymax!

1239
01:24:14,054 --> 01:24:16,354
My sensor is detecting signs of life.

1240
01:24:16,557 --> 01:24:19,387
- What?
- Coming from there.

1241
01:24:19,643 --> 01:24:21,313
The life signs are female.

1242
01:24:21,562 --> 01:24:23,732
She appears to be in hyper-sleep.

1243
01:24:24,231 --> 01:24:27,071
Callaghan's daughter. She's still alive.

1244
01:24:27,401 --> 01:24:28,611
Abigail.

1245
01:24:30,237 --> 01:24:31,447
Let's go get her.

1246
01:24:31,655 --> 01:24:34,325
The portal is destabilizing.
You'll never make it.

1247
01:24:34,992 --> 01:24:36,492
She's alive in there.

1248
01:24:36,743 --> 01:24:38,373
Someone has to help.

1249
01:24:39,329 --> 01:24:41,289
What do you say, buddy?

1250
01:24:41,498 --> 01:24:44,168
Flying makes me
a better healthcare companion.

1251
01:25:11,695 --> 01:25:13,945
Careful! There's krei
tech debris everywhere.

1252
01:25:31,715 --> 01:25:33,125
Look out!

1253
01:25:41,975 --> 01:25:43,435
I have located the patient.

1254
01:25:47,397 --> 01:25:48,687
Hurry!

1255
01:26:06,375 --> 01:26:07,925
Come on, buddy, let's get her home.

1256
01:26:13,257 --> 01:26:15,547
I'll guide you out of here. Let's go!

1257
01:26:21,765 --> 01:26:23,095
Veer right!

1258
01:26:23,934 --> 01:26:26,024
Okay, to the left.

1259
01:26:26,812 --> 01:26:28,232
Hard right!

1260
01:26:29,439 --> 01:26:30,689
Up and over.

1261
01:26:32,025 --> 01:26:34,275
Okay, level off. Easy.

1262
01:26:36,446 --> 01:26:38,446
Nice flying!

1263
01:26:40,826 --> 01:26:42,366
Almost there!

1264
01:26:47,624 --> 01:26:48,634
Baymax!

1265
01:26:59,052 --> 01:27:00,222
Baymax!

1266
01:27:08,645 --> 01:27:10,305
My thrusters are inoperable.

1267
01:27:10,439 --> 01:27:11,439
Just grab hold.

1268
01:27:21,158 --> 01:27:24,408
There is still a way
I can get you both to safety.

1269
01:27:29,416 --> 01:27:32,456
I cannot deactivate until you say
you are satisfied with your care.

1270
01:27:32,669 --> 01:27:34,959
No, no, no, no. Wait. What about you?

1271
01:27:35,339 --> 01:27:36,839
- You are my patient.
- Baymax.

1272
01:27:37,007 --> 01:27:38,427
Your health is my only concern.

1273
01:27:38,675 --> 01:27:40,175
Stop! I'm gonna figure out...

1274
01:27:40,427 --> 01:27:41,927
Are you satisfied with your care?

1275
01:27:42,054 --> 01:27:43,854
No. There's gotta be another way.

1276
01:27:44,097 --> 01:27:46,977
I'm not gonna leave you here.
I'll think of something.

1277
01:27:47,184 --> 01:27:48,524
There is no time.

1278
01:27:48,769 --> 01:27:50,439
Are you satisfied with your care?

1279
01:27:50,687 --> 01:27:53,147
Please! No...

1280
01:27:54,525 --> 01:27:56,325
I can't lose you, too.

1281
01:27:56,568 --> 01:27:57,688
Hiro,

1282
01:27:59,363 --> 01:28:01,783
I will always be with you.

1283
01:28:25,764 --> 01:28:27,894
I'm satisfied with my care.

1284
01:29:04,845 --> 01:29:05,935
Hiro!

1285
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:08,100
Yeah! They made it!

1286
01:29:11,852 --> 01:29:13,062
Baymax?

1287
01:29:30,621 --> 01:29:33,461
Miss, can you hear me?
What is your name?

1288
01:29:33,957 --> 01:29:35,577
Abigail Callaghan.

1289
01:29:35,792 --> 01:29:38,382
Okay, Abigail, you are gonna be fine.

1290
01:29:38,504 --> 01:29:39,824
We're taking you to the hospital.

1291
01:29:41,048 --> 01:29:42,048
Move it!

1292
01:29:44,301 --> 01:29:46,551
Get in there.

1293
01:30:01,485 --> 01:30:03,155
A massive cleanup continues today

1294
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:05,320
at the headquarters
of krei tech industries.

1295
01:30:05,531 --> 01:30:08,831
Reports are still flooding in about
a group of unidentified individuals,

1296
01:30:09,076 --> 01:30:12,116
who prevented what could have been
a major catastrophe.

1297
01:30:12,329 --> 01:30:14,829
The whole city
of San fransokyo is asking,

1298
01:30:14,998 --> 01:30:17,328
"who are these heroes?
And where are they now?"

1299
01:30:17,501 --> 01:30:18,841
- Hey.
- Hi.

1300
01:30:19,878 --> 01:30:21,088
It's so exciting.

1301
01:30:21,213 --> 01:30:22,513
Hey, sweetie!

1302
01:30:22,673 --> 01:30:23,763
Okay.

1303
01:30:27,219 --> 01:30:28,349
Last hug.

1304
01:30:30,514 --> 01:30:31,684
Bye!

1305
01:30:32,266 --> 01:30:35,346
- And just then I was like...
- Get out of here.

1306
01:31:14,391 --> 01:31:15,391
Ow?

1307
01:31:18,729 --> 01:31:22,729
I am baymax,
your personal healthcare companion.

1308
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:24,530
Hello, Hiro.

1309
01:31:37,456 --> 01:31:39,706
We didn't set out to be superheroes,

1310
01:31:39,917 --> 01:31:43,087
but sometimes life doesn't go
the way you planned.

1311
01:31:46,673 --> 01:31:49,263
The good thing is, my brother
wanted to help a lot of people,

1312
01:31:49,426 --> 01:31:51,006
and that's what we're gonna do.

1313
01:31:51,512 --> 01:31:52,722
Who are we?

1314
01:40:22,272 --> 01:40:26,442
Dad, I just wish I could share
my accomplishments with you.

1315
01:40:26,652 --> 01:40:28,452
You mean so much to me, and honestly,

1316
01:40:28,779 --> 01:40:29,949
I've always felt a distance

1317
01:40:30,155 --> 01:40:33,365
what with you being
on the family island all the time,

1318
01:40:34,076 --> 01:40:35,736
and I just wish you could see how...

1319
01:40:50,968 --> 01:40:52,138
Fred.

1320
01:40:58,976 --> 01:40:59,976
Son.

1321
01:41:00,811 --> 01:41:01,941
Dad?

1322
01:41:04,606 --> 01:41:08,316
I wear 'em front, I wear 'em back.

1323
01:41:08,694 --> 01:41:13,624
I go inside out, then I go front and back.

1324
01:41:13,824 --> 01:41:14,994
Dad!

1325
01:41:17,244 --> 01:41:20,294
We have a lot to talk about.

1326
01:41:20,394 --> 01:41:25,394
